# Goals

**I'm now looking to grow as a developer**. I know I am lacking some skills and that I need to improve them. Nevertheless, I'm a dedicated and fast learner, a liable person as well as a developer. I got nothing to hide, as you can see\; I'm an open book. I work in the same way. Honest, detailed, and responsible.

As I'm looking for opportunities to grow, offers where some kind of mentorship is on the table, in any of its forms, are very tempting to me.

**I'm also looking for flexible work hours**. For companies who focus more on deadlines rather than strict work hours, I believe I would be a nice addition.

**I am NOT looking for presential work, ONLY REMOTE** (Not negotiable). My life outside of work is very important, and it is very diverse, ranging from familiar to recreational and even spiritual. I would not trade this for money.
