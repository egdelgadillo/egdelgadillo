## Strengths

- I'm a **very good team worker**. I'm not competitive by nature, so I don't mind suggestions and accepting advice when they are correct.

- Not afraid of criticism. I **love constructive criticism**, as long as it's not aggressive nor done in bad-faith. I'm aware that _I need to improve_ and I won't be able to do so if nobody corrects me. Therefore, **criticism is welcomed in order to improve**.

- **Very fast learner**. I mean, I'm very fast at picking up new concepts, as long as I'm able to apply that knowledge or relate it with previously know concepts.

- Not afraid to suggest. I'm up for improving and learning. No matter who is the leader, if it is my place and right to do it, I am able to suggest ideas and come up with solutions.

- Not afraid to lead whenever I know I have the required level to do so. Taking the lead _is not something I crave_ (I'm not trying to stand out all the time) _but I'm not afraid to do it and I possess the right skills to do it_.

## Weaknesses

- I'm not a very good designer (yet). This is something that doesn't come naturally to me (as do others), therefore **I must exercise it**. _This does not include replicating templates already done by designers_. It applies to the creative process of choosing and combining colors, shapes, and sizes.

- Reading long documentations. I mean, we've all been there. Sometimes I'm lazy while reading long and exhaustive documentation. **I prefer to cut to the chase and just extract the data I'm looking for**, or needing to apply and just do it.
