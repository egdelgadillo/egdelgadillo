### Hola! 👋 Welcome to my Github Profile! 😄

Nice to meet you, I'm Emiliano G. Delgadillo. Let me tell you a bit about myself...

I'm a Latin American developer. I'm currently living in **Argentina** (_GMT-3_), the country of the world famous 🥩 **asado** and one of the world's biggest 🧉 **mate** consumer per capita. Both have accompanied me through my life, from a toddler to a professional developer, and I share my dearest memories with them. But that's just food... I didn't even tell you anything about my friends, family, teachers, my wife... well, you get the idea... 😉

## 📓 My history

Wanna know what drives me? How I came to be the developer I am now? Read this **exciting** story about me, developing myself in the **IT** world...
<br>

<details>
  <summary>📀 <b>Humble Beginnings</b></summary>
  <br>

Well, it all started when I was very young. My dad was what you would call "an 🖥️ _IT guy_" back in the 90s (_Amazingly a self-taught one, which back in the day was pretty hard._ ~~youtube~~ ~~stackoverflow~~ ~~skillshare~~😉). He had his way with early UNIX systems, and brought bread to our home every day. Even though he didn't intend to, he transferred his skills to me.

Later when I was 16 (2007), I was introduced to the ~~brand new~~ 💽 **pascal** language! Only 1 lesson was enough for me (And all I got, btw) and I started solving math problems, limits, calculating capacitor values for given circuit impedances (I went to an electrician school). Of course, the language had its limits, and wasn't that big of a deal amongst other developers.

  <summary>🎥 <b>Time to Hack...</b></summary>
  <br>

[Die Hard 4.0](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/) did it for me (That's how it was known outside of the US). I wanted to be that 🥷 ninja hacker! I wanted to [roll out a plastic ⌨️ keyboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1yluaw/hackers_in_live_free_or_die_hard_use_the_worst/) and start throwing code like everyone's lives depended on it. Of course, it was all 🎥 Hollywood magic (And lies...), but I was decided, **I wanted to be a hacker**.

Long story short, I started frequenting "hacker" forums and learned all I ever needed about **Cybersecurity**. Although I didn't become a Hacker, I had my first mentoring on other awesome languages, such as 🤡 **batch** (Yeah, I know, but trust me, it sounded way much better back then 😜). Nevertheless, those times were very helpful. I learnt **visual basic**, some **C** and **C++** (Which I didn't fully understand at that time, I even printed a FAT free PDF, but still no use...), some primitive **javascript** and **HTML**. Also I understood what a **page defacement** is, what **DOS** and **DDOS** are, what **SQL Injection** is, how to test and attack and **how to defend against them**.

By that time, I started reading the [Hack x Crack](https://hackxcrack.net/foro/cuadernos_antiguos/) magazines, which wasn't very easy as they were banned from being published on Spain due to legal issues (I know, I lived in Argentina, still I red them online). I remember reading about **C&C** experiments, **passive vs active connections** to bypass firewalls. Until then I was still a Linux-virgin until **Backtrack** came into my life (Now known as **Kali Linux**) also thanks to those magazines. My first experiences with **aircrack** and **WEP** vs **WPA** security issues was amazing. Binary **Cracking** and some kind of **reverse engineering** was the last thing I learnt at that period of time. It was awesome to learn basic **assembler** and to be able to reverse some **CrackMe**s. I learnt a lot with that experience, what a **BUS** is, what an **x86** architecture and instructions are, how the **hexadecimal** numeric system works, how the **binary** system works, how a computer _really_ works; I felt like NEO 😜.

Some years before that I started playing a MMORPG called Silkroad (Now extinct), but it was the usual, hunt mobs, get XP, items, level up, repeat king of thing. It got tedious over time. So with all the knowledge I now had I got to code my first personal project, a 1k+ line macro bot using **AutoIt**, a macro programming language, very easy to use. There I harnessed the power of **loops** and **functional programming**. I also had to modify the game client to allow me to use the bot, and for that I had to patch the executable, injecting some in-memory modified (**ASM**) jumps right after executing it, and thus unlock some in-game features. Too bad I lost it all... (A harsh lesson I learned because of the lack of proper backups). Still, golden ages for me.

The experience I acquired with **ASM** was very helpful when I had to present a (sort of) practical-thesis before graduating at school. The **electronics** subject required me to program a **PIC** microcontroller, whatever we wanted to do (Yes, the school I went to taught me a lot of different things, I mean A LOT...). My team and I built some sort of 3d printer base, in which you communicated the coordinates from the PC to the PIC and the base moved to those coords. It was a very fun project to be honest. We had to use the **hexadecimal** numeric system, the **binary** system, and some kind of simplified **ASM** language to program the PIC. Needless to say, we were the most advanced team of the complete course 😉.

Although I didn't become a hacker, I learnt AWESOME things many of which I still use and apply up to this days. Even more when I became a System Administrator...

  <summary>🤓 <b>The new IT guy</b></summary>
  <br>

After graduating with honors, I had to go out and get a job. Oh well, that wasn't very easy, even though I knew all I knew. What should I do with all my acquired knowledge? The easiest and fastest job was to start doing **PC repair**. So following my father steps I became the "new _IT guy_ 🤓". It was alright, but deleting viruses, reinstalling Windows and restoring backups wasn't very challenging at all. In 2012, my father encouraged me to take on a Cisco's CCNA 1 course, and I did (It's now expired). Oh boy, **networking**, that was HARD... even more at a Cisco course. The teacher was alright, the problem was I 😜. Although I finished it and passed the tests, I didn't have anywhere to apply that knowledge. All I had was a home WiFi to experiment with, which wasn't very exciting.

  <summary>🌐 <b>Network Administrator</b></summary>
  <br>

Well, well, well, after all, my father's recommendations onc again bore fruit. In 2015 a gubernamental agency of the Province of Neuquén (Where I lived) called **OPTIC** needed to fill a **Network Administrator** position. The requirement was a **CCNA** title, and although I only did the first of four courses, it was enough for them. I was less than a junior, but they didn't care. But still, I delivered.

There I got to "play around" and learn from thousands of devices, ranging from **Cisco Switches/Routers/Cores** to long-range connectivity antennas such as **Ubiquity**. Now I could understand all I learnt at the CCNA 1 course. They were literally **thousands of devices** spread across the whole province. Managing them all was a very daunting task, as we were only 3 who had access to all of them. That's how I had my first professional experiences with developing. I started learning **Python 2.7** to automate many of the repetitive tasks, such as testing, checking, rebooting devices, running automated scripts to improve security on the devices (Which had some serious security issues, I mean, really serious, but fortunately they were all prevented thanks to them).

As we had so many devices, and no one could remember them all (And were not properly documented) I started setting up a database for them all. I started with primitive **HTML** and **CSS** plus a **mySQL** database. It looked like a _Win95_ app, but it did the job. Later I started experimenting with **Meteor.js** which was considered "😎 cool" at the time. It had support for **Socket.io** and it was all like "Wow! Real time dude!". Well, I tried, but it wasn't easy for me at first. Too much to cover at once. Still **MongoDB** was the revelation of the century for me... I mean, not having to drop the complete database just to add one more "column" to the "table"... 🤯 mindblowing... (Of course, **field** and **collection** are the right terms for **MongoDB**, I know, just bare with me 😛). So eventually, the system got a nice upgrade! But not just for the backend, but also for the front end, using **Angular.JS** with **Bootstrap 3** which was also the next big thing.

I still got backups of those times... But networking wasn't gonna cut it. As you can tell by now, I had the urge to develop!

  <summary>🖥️ <b>System Administrator</b></summary>
  <br>

Some years later, in 2017, I switched positions within the same organization. An open position appeared, a System Administrator position. I loved it. Now I was able to level up my Operating Systems skills. Still, we were a small team of 3, so we had A LOT of work to do. Hundreds of **Linux and Windows virtual machines**, **Internet Access** using **squid proxy** for thousands of users every day, managing access and **content filtering** using both squid proxies and **firewalls** for both old and new users, of course **load balancing** them all due to the sheer amount of users, setting up and upgrading the **email services** using **Postfix and Dovecot**, **Networking**, managing the **DMZ**, installing **VMWare and OracleVM** on the Datacenter blades, **backups**, **Cybersecurity**, and the list goes on and on...

This was the time when I learnt the most and the fastest. It was amazing, though not without its disadvantages. We were a super tiny team handling the responsibility dozens or hundreds should. Sometimes the amount of work and problems surpassed us; we couldn't keep up. Nevertheless, we had some peaceful times, specially during the holidays. Many new projects were born during those times, some still stand while other died right there. We had the liberty to experiment, test, apply and grow, both as Developers and as SysAdmins. I'm not sure if this was already what you would call a **DevOps** area, but we were there.

Yes, I said "Developer". We had so much stuff, we needed automation for most. **Bash** was my second best friend here. All **Debian and RedHat-based Linux OS(es)** had some bit of automation, whether it be for security, repetitive tasks, reports, you name it. I really believe I could not have got a better "education" than being there, hands on keyboard, googling, _StackOverflowing_, researching, testing and admiring the beauty of what we managed to create.

But if Bash was my second best friend, **Python** (2.7) was my best best friend. What didn't I create with it? From automation scripts, to managing **LDAP** registries, doing daily **internet consumption reports** (by categories, organizations, location, etc) from millions upon millions of lines of **squid reports**. If this isn't the closest I've been to **Big Data** I don't know what could. Still, managing dozens of daily requests for new internet access, new email users, new virtual machines and new LDAP users was a big task for such a busy and small team. We needed **automation**.

And it actually came in the form of a **Python Flask** backend service serving an **AngularJS + Bootstrap** front end service. They were actually two systems, one of the public, for requesting, managing and accessing their own data, and another one for handling all those requests plus other sector-related work. I loved this project, I developed it all by myself, and it was quite a learning experience. It got to the point where I got to **understand the disadvantages** of big projects served by Flask and the **limitations of Angular.JS**. No matter, I made it work anyways. I even had my way with **Java** to handle the **digital singing of PDFs** using our proprietary digital signature service. I was so proud of it all...

  <summary>🚨 <b>console.error('Huston, we got a problem...')</b></summary>
  <br>

So, you might already see the problem which took me several years to understand:

> I had A LOT of knowledge about MANY things, but still **I wasn't a professional in any of them!**

Yup, over the years I got so focused on **learning new things** that I neglected the fact that I had to **start focusing on one thing** to be able to do it right, professionally right. I wasn't confident enough to provide my services to others, and with good reason. I knew a bit of everything, but not enough of any.

Also, work got too political, you know, "deliver fast no matter what" for political campaigns. I started to really dislike the lack of professionalism and good practices, I mean we couldn't, we really couldn't. Besides, the Argentine Peso, the local currency, started loosing value, inflation was a common topic amongst others.

So I decided I wanted to work online, get rid of the local economy and be able to **learn one subject really well** and be confident enough to provide my services, to become a **professional developer**. Well, **good things don't come easy**, and this wasn't the exception. I had to get rid of my old habits, and really focus on one thing, until I learned it well enough. "How?" I wondered...

<details>
  <summary><b>Freelancing</b></summary>
  <br>

A **dear friend of mine**, an superb developer, to whom I owe a lot, helped me. He gave me whet I needed the most: _encouragement and mentorship_. So under his wing I invested months upon months of study, practice, tutorials, projects and of course work. I am very grateful to him for what he's done.

So, my weapon of choice was... **javascript**, my old friend and foe. But now, with a twist. I started learning it _again_ from the bottom up. I started with **Javascript** to **NodeJS**, until I met **Typescript**. A new era was dawning...

For me, this was the revelation of the century. It wasn't the **Human Genome Project** nor was **SpaceX rockets landing vertically**. It was **Typescript** all along. I mean, combine the power and flexibility of Javascript and above that add the strict typing of other OOP languages like C#, and you get the Typescript **superset**, which even **transpiles your code to JS**. It's magical.

So yeah, now I'm perfecting my **Typescript skills**, becoming a professional developer for the first time. I'm very confident now as a developer, who doesn't know it all, but now knows enough.

</details>
<br>

So this is a **very detailed** history of me. Did you like it? Pretty amazing if you ask me 😛

### TL;DR

Long story short, I'm a developer who knows A LOT of MANY things, but who is now focusing on learning fewer things but at a more professional level, in depth.
