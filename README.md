### Hola! 👋 Welcome to my Github Profile! 😄

Nice to meet you, I'm Emiliano G. Delgadillo. Let me tell you a bit about myself...

I'm a Latin American developer. I'm currently living in **Argentina** (_GMT-3_), the country of the world famous 🥩 **asado** and one of the world's biggest 🧉 **mate** consumer per capita. Both have accompanied me through my life, from a toddler to a professional developer, and I share my dearest memories with them. But that's just food... I didn't even tell you anything about my friends, family, teachers, my wife... well, you get the idea... 😉

### IT Fanboy

Well, it all started when I was very young. My dad was what you would call "an 🖥️ _IT guy_", he had his way with early UNIX systems, asd brought bread to our home every day. Even though he didn't intend to, he transfered his skills to me.

Later when I was 16, I was introduced to the ~~brand new~~ 💽 **pascal** language!

Well, but I bet you're not here to chat. Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
