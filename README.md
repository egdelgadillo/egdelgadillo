# Hola! I'm Emiliano G. Delgadillo 👋

<sub><sup> (_Wanna know what the "**G.**" stands for? [Contact me!](#contact--availability)_ 😉)</sup></sub>

#### Freelance Software Developer, IT Pro & Tech Enthusiast

Self-taught, fast-learner and highly motivated **Fullstack Software Developer**, specializing in Typescript.

Born in **'91**, I have  **great passion** for what I do, specially when I code; I see it as an _art form_. **I don't let 🤖 AI take over**, although I do let it help me with menial tasks, specially when it comes to plain text geneation/interpretation (Not this though, what you're reading is 100% handmade!)

I'm currently living in **Paraguay** (_GMT-3_), but I'm originally from **Argentina**, the country of the world-famous 🥩 **Asado** and one of the world's biggest 🧉 **Mate** consumers per capita. The latter, specially, has accompanied me through my life, from a toddler to a professional developer.

Nobody's perfect and I don't claim to be. _I make mistakes_ like everybody else and **I'll be the first to admit them**.

I'm funny, I have _strong opinions_ and I like debating; _If I don't like it you'll know about it_ (But you'll have fun, I promise). But I'm **open** to new suggestions and trying out new stuff, even if it's difficult. **No guts no glory!**
