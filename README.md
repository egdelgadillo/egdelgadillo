### Hola! 👋 Welcome to my Github Profile! 😄

Nice to meet you, I'm Emiliano G. Delgadillo. Let me tell you a bit about myself...

I'm a Latin American developer. I'm currently living in **Argentina** (_GMT-3_), the country of the world famous 🥩 **asado** and one of the world's biggest 🧉 **mate** consumer per capita. Both have accompanied me through my life, from a toddler to a professional developer, and I share my dearest memories with them. But that's just food... I didn't even tell you anything about my friends, family, teachers, my wife... well, you get the idea... 😉

## 📓 My history

Wanna know what drives me? How I came to be the developer I am now? Read this **exciting** story about me, developing myself in the **IT** world...

  <summary>📀 <b>Humble Beginnings</b></summary>
  <br>

Well, it all started when I was very young. My dad was what you would call "an 🖥️ _IT guy_" back in the 90s (_Amazingly a self-taught one, which back in the day was pretty hard._ ~~youtube~~ ~~stackoverflow~~ ~~skillshare~~😉). He had his way with early UNIX systems, and brought bread to our home every day. Even though he didn't intend to, he transferred his skills to me.

Later when I was 16 (2007), I was introduced to the ~~brand new~~ 💽 **pascal** language! Only 1 lesson was enough for me (And all I got, btw) and I started solving math problems, limits, calculating capacitor values for given circuit impedances (I went to an electrician school). Of course, the language had its limits, and wasn't that big of a deal amongst other developers.

  <summary>🎥 <b>Time to Hack...</b></summary>
  <br>

[Die Hard 4.0](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/) did it for me (That's how it was known outside of the US). I wanted to be that 🥷 ninja hacker! I wanted to [roll out a plastic ⌨️ keyboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1yluaw/hackers_in_live_free_or_die_hard_use_the_worst/) and start throwing code like everyone's lives depended on it. Of course, it was all 🎥 Hollywood magic (And lies...), but I was decided, **I wanted to be a hacker**.

Long story short, I started frequenting "hacker" forums and learned all I ever needed about **Cybersecurity**. Although I didn't become a Hacker, I had my first mentoring on other awesome languages, such as 🤡 **batch** (Yeah, I know, but trust me, it sounded way much better back then 😜). Nevertheless, those times were very helpful. I learnt **visual basic**, some **C** and **C++** (Which I didn't fully understand at that time, I even printed a FAT free PDF, but still no use...), some primitive **javascript** and **HTML**. Also I understood what a **page defacement** is, what **DOS** and **DDOS** are, what **SQL Injection** is, how to test and attack and **how to defend against them**.

By that time, I started reading the [Hack x Crack](https://hackxcrack.net/foro/cuadernos_antiguos/) magazines, which wasn't very easy as they were banned from being published on Spain due to legal issues (I know, I lived in Argentina, still I red them online). I remember reading about **C&C** experiments, **passive vs active connections** to bypass firewalls. Until then I was still a Linux-virgin until **Backtrack** came into my life (Now known as **Kali Linux**) also thanks to those magazines. My first experiences with **aircrack** and **WEP** vs **WPA** security issues was amazing. Binary **Cracking** and some kind of **reverse engineering** was the last thing I learnt at that period of time. It was awesome to learn basic **assembler** and to be able to reverse some **CrackMe**s. I learnt a lot with that experience, what a **BUS** is, what an **x86** architecture and instructions are, how the **hexadecimal** numeric system works, how the **binary** system works, how a computer _really_ works; I felt like NEO 😜.

Some years before that I started playing a MMORPG called Silkroad (Now extinct), but it was the usual, hunt mobs, get XP, items, level up, repeat king of thing. It got tedious over time. So with all the knowledge I now had I got to code my first personal project, a 1k+ line macro bot using **AutoIt**, a macro programming language, very easy to use. There I harnessed the power of **loops** and **functional programming**. I also had to modify the game client to allow me to use the bot, and for that I had to patch the executable, injecting some in-memory modified (**ASM**) jumps right after executing it, and thus unlock some in-game features. Too bad I lost it all... (A harsh lesson I learned because of the lack of proper backups). Still, golden ages for me.

The experience I acquired with **ASM** was very helpful when I had to present a (sort of) practical-thesis before graduating at school. The **electronics** subject required me to program a **PIC** microcontroller, whatever we wanted to do (Yes, the school I went to taught me a lot of different things, I mean A LOT...). My team and I built some sort of 3d printer base, in which you communicated the coordinates from the PC to the PIC and the base moved to those coords. It was a very fun project to be honest. We had to use the **hexadecimal** numeric system, the **binary** system, and some kind of simplified **ASM** language to program the PIC. Needless to say, we were the most advanced team of the complete course 😉.

Although I didn't become a hacker, I learnt AWESOME things many of which I still use and apply up to this days. Even more when I became a System Administrator...

  <summary>🤓 <b>The new IT guy</b></summary>
  <br>

After graduating with honors, I had to go out and get a job. Oh well, that wasn't very easy, even though I knew all I knew. What should I do with all my acquired knowledge? The easiest and fastest job was to start doing **PC repair**. So following my father steps I became the "new _IT guy_ 🤓". It was alright, but deleting viruses, reinstalling Windows and restoring backups wasn't very challenging at all. In 2012, my father encouraged me to take on a Cisco's CCNA 1 course, and I did (It's now expired). Oh boy, **networking**, that was HARD... even more at a Cisco course. The teacher was alright, the problem was I 😜. Although I finished it and passed the tests, I didn't have anywhere to apply that knowledge. All I had was a home WiFi to experiment with, which wasn't very exciting.

  <summary>🌐 <b>Network Administrator</b></summary>
  <br>

Well, well, well, after all, my father's recommendations bear fruit once again. In 2015 a gubernamental agency of the Province of Neuquén (Where I lived) called **OPTIC** needed to fill a **Network Administrator** position. The requirement was a **CCNA** title, and although I only did the first of four courses, it was enough for them. I was less than a junior, but they didn't care. But still, I delivered.

There I got to "play around" and learn from thousands of devices, ranging from **Cisco Switches/Routers/Cores** to long-range connectivity antennas such as **Ubiquity**. Now I could understand all I learnt at the CCNA 1 course. They were literally **thousands of devices** spread across the whole province. Managing them all was a very daunting task, as we were only 3 who had access to all of them. That's how I had my first professional experiences with developing. I started learning **Python 2.7** to automate many of the repetitive tasks, such as testing, checking, rebooting devices, running automated scripts to improve security on the devices (Which had some serious security issues, I mean, really serious, but fortunately they were all prevented thanks to them).

As we had so many devices, and no one could remember them all (And were not properly documented) I started setting up a database for them all. I started with primitive **HTML** and **CSS** plus a **mySQL** database. It looked like a _Win95_ app, but it did the job. Later I started experimenting with **Meteor.js** which was considered "😎 cool" at the time. It had support for **Socket.io** and it was all like "Wow! Real time dude!". Well, I tried, but it wasn't easy for me at first. Too much to cover at once. Still **MongoDB** was the revelation of the century for me... I mean, not having to drop the complete database just to add one more "column" to the "table"... 🤯 mindblowing... (Of course, **field** and **collection** are the right terms for **MongoDB**, I know, just bare with me 😛). So eventually, the system got a nice upgrade! But not just for the backend, but also for the front end, using **Angular.JS** with **Bootstrap 3** which was also the next big thing.

I still got backups of those times... But networking wasn't gonna cut it. As you can tell by now, I had the urge to develop!
